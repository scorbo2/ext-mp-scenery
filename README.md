# ext-mp-scenery

A visualizer extension for musicplayer to show gently scrolling background scenery and companions who offer
customizable commentary on the current track, current artist, and/or current scenery.

General idea:

1. Have a very wide landscape image that we can slowly scroll back and forth.
2. Have configurable "companions" (animated characters) that can pop up at configurable intervals to display information.
3. Use text animation to display messages from these companions.
4. Companion text messages could be purely informational ("current track is XYZ by the artist ABC" or whatever), OR could be configurable based on the scenery image.

TODO: all of this in progress!

TODO: package up a couple of example companions and some sample scenery. 
      But the main idea is that the user can provide their own (via extension config)

## Requirements

MusicPlayer 2.8 or higher.
