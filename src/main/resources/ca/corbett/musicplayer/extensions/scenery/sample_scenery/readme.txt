These are massively-compressed jpeg examples just so that there are some scenery images "out of the box".

The intention is to use the scenery external dir to put a bunch of proper hi-res images.
If your scenery dir is unspecified or empty, then you get the built-ins and you'll like them.
As soon as you start adding scenery images to your scenery dir, the built-ins will no longer be used.

Scrolling will happen automatically:
  - for portrait images, vertical up-and-down scrolling
  - for landscape images, horizontal back-and-forth scaling
