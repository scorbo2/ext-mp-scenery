These are massively-compressed jpeg examples just so that there are some scenery images "out of the box".

The intention is to use the scenery external dir to put a bunch of proper hi-res images.

Scrolling will happen automatically:
  - for portrait images, vertical up-and-down scrolling
  - for landscape images, horizontal back-and-forth scaling
