# ext-mp-scenery

A visualizer extension for musicplayer to show gently scrolling background scenery.

General idea:

1. Have a very wide landscape image that we can slowly scroll back and forth.
2. Have configurable "avatars" (animated characters) that can pop up at configurable intervals to display information.
3. Use text animation to display messages from these avatars.
4. Avatar text messages could be purely informational ("current track is XYZ by the artist ABC" or whatever), OR could be configurable based on the scenery image.

TODO: all of this in progress!

TODO: package up a couple of example avatars and some sample scenery. 
      But the main idea is that the user can provide their own (via extension config)
